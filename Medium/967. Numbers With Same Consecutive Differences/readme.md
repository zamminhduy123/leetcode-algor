# Thought Process

First i think of looping through all the number from 1..000 (n time) to 9..99 (n time) and check the condition of each number by turning it to string

But it was so bad that i got time limit exceed on submit

# Re-think

so i tried another way -> which is find the exact number -> not looping through all unknown number -> which use recursion (dfs) in this case

pretty ez the code show all the thoughts step so i won't explain here
